Why viteSicure In Italy, 48% of families do not save, 61% suffer from anxiety about the economic future of the family and only 6% have life protection insurance. This is called Protection GAP (difference between resources needed and available at the death of the head of the family) and is a worldwide problem while companies are still focused on offering savings products, not aligned with the new buying habits of customers, with complicated and old processes, ignoring the millions of financially vulnerable customers. Customers are online, reacting to advertising and using technology and so we believed that digital transformation was the solution to engage customers, educate them about the insurance solution, reduce the distance to insurance and meet the demands and needs immediately. Technology is our enabler for reaching the financially vulnerable. Our open API platform enables fully digital processes not only with insurance companies as is the case with most digital brokers but across the entire value chain thus enabling full transformation and integration of processes. We use APIs for partner integration, for the omni-digital customer service system and even for trustpilot for example. viteSicure is therefore the only one that boasts a fully digital customer onboarding, marketing funnel and customer service that for the customer means a quick and easy journey for a unique insurance buying experience that is aligned with their buying habits.

Output of these also include data for consignment rates (dynamic and affected by things such as volatility and demand, objectively calculated) and discounts. dropout is looking to scale this, simple yet efficient, model, for many other things retail and e-commerce and is currently studying the creation of a portal for investment in sneakers as alternative assets. HypeAnalyzer is covered by commercial patent in Italy (SIAE, D000014993) and dropout® is trademarked at continental level. Initially opened with no external funding, in October 2021 dropout launched its first funding round, raising €750k via equity crowdfunding in a lightning 6 days, following the board approval of an extension of the initial €500k goal (reached in 4 days out of a 62 days campaign). The move will see dropout open a new retail location as well the opening of several temporary locations throughout Italy; improve its e-commerce and the further development of HypeAnalyzer. The campaign saw the participation of 2 Italian VC funds and over 150 retail investors, who join the founding team made of Kola Tytler, Andrea Canziani, Federico Pasquetti and Stefano Zeppieri.",,contact@dropoutmilano.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/dropoutmilano/,https://www.dropoutmilano.com,,,,,2018-06-01,month,Active,Business specialized in the sale of limited edition sneakers and streetwear,,20123,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",

Work status and multi-user: users can report their work status directly on their profile, choosing from several options such as “Available for work,” “Busy but interested in other proposals,” or “Busy.” This feature is useful for immediately indicating one's availability to companies and vice versa. In addition, the platform supports multi-user profiles, allowing you to easily switch between them.

Through innovative social media campaigns and a booking platform, we raise awareness among young people, encouraging them to book donations at nearby centers and providing instant chat access with hematologists to address their concerns. For companies, we offer a welfare service and sustainability membership that engages employees in health prevention and blood donation. We organize awareness webinars, donation days, and monitor employee health, providing impact reports. These activities are included in the company's sustainability report and contribute to B-Corp certification. Our third pillar involves management software for hospitals. We offer a plugin that optimizes blood stock management in hospitals by managing donor portfolios and the relationships between donors, associations, and hospitals. By knowing the blood stock levels, we can send automatic recalls or alerts when blood is needed and there are donors nearby ready to donate.

We built a digital platform to facilitate the exchange of travel ideas and tips, where the ones looking for inspiration for their next destination can meet the stories of those who have already been there. Treepli is a community of travelers where the most experts become content creators, proposing detailed itineraries, including all info regarding where to sleep, how to move around, what to do and must-see places. All these useful recommendations are shared together with their own storytelling, made of photos, images and emotions experienced along the way. On the other hand, users that are willing to plan a trip, thanks to these genuine and first-hand tips, can organise each stop in a simple and intuitive manner. Just need to pick and choose an itinerary among the ones available in the portal, customise it based on the personal needs, and finally book each single travel product, from the outbound flight to the museum entrance fee, in a single seamless flow. This is a win-win mechanism: who is looking for ideas but is not willing to get the usual pre-packaged tour can actually create his own tailored trip, who shares his stories and hidden gems can value his experience, getting rewarded based on how many users he inspired to hit the road.

Once the adoption request has been sent, users will be able to access their own private area where they will be able to monitor the status of their request (online form accepted/rejected, the face-to-face meeting passed/rejected, adoption accepted/rejected). In addition to this, Empethy offers a personalized online consultation service in order to provide an array of useful tips and advice aimed at ""preparing"" the future adopter for a conscious and responsible adoption of the future dog/ cat. On the other hand, animal shelters, rescue groups, volunteers can upload their adoption ads easily and quickly by filling out a standardized online form containing all the information needed for a conscious adoption decision (e.g. personal data, vaccinations/castrations, special needs, pathologies, etc.). Once created their own profiles, associations will be able to access their private area, where they will be able to manage all incoming requests (accept/reject the online form, accept/reject face-to-face meeting, accept/reject adoption) for each individual pet in a more standardized and automated way.

The system was created to solve the cleaning problem in urban contexts directly through the city. Indeed, the mobile robots are little autonomous sweepers, which are able to get around the surroundings whilst collecting waste and avoiding obstacles, both static and dynamic, to then dock inside the bench and be charged thanks to solar energy.  Our aim is to develop an urban space which takes advantage of IoT devices, scattered around the city, to constantly sense and respond to the environment, while collecting useful data that will improve the management of the entire urban realm.  Pixies’s strength is its bottom-up approach to the problem of cleaning within cities, which ensures a very high level of efficiency, since it is a 24/7 on site, quick and sustainable solution. Moreover, thanks to the presence of the smart benches, we will have fixed charging stations directly installed around the city, thus giving a new piece of urban furniture, useful both for the environment and for the citizens. It's important to point out that the implementation of Pixies for cleaning purposes is only the beginning. Please, bear in mind that this system can be used within cities for a thousand other applications (delivery, first aid, mobile charging for vehicles, etc.), always remaining bottom-up, efficient and sustainable because it is embedded with the urban space. The competitive advantage of Pixies is its bottom-up approach to the problem of cleaning. Indeed, Pixies integrates the robots directly into the city, through the use of smart benches as charging bases for them. So far, Pixies has installed the prototype of the robot and the smart bench in the courtyard of the mixed-use building ( residential, hotel and offices) where the company is based, here in Rome, making it active and supervised by ourselves every day.  The system works perfectly. It's able to operate up to 8 hours per day, covering an area of 2'000 sqm, both indoor (300 sqm) and outdoor (1'700 sqm).  As results, the cleaning efficiency has been increased of about 30% and the related cost has been, therefore, reduced of about 40%. Our closest competitors are : Trombia, Enway, Idriverplus, TSM. However, we can also add to these other companies that have developed solutions for the autonomous indoor cleaning.

The Company has the mission to develop IoT sensors, devices and gateways and to be highly innovative. With its tiny but high potential product line THE TACTIGON, the Company is going to revolutionize user experience with gesture controllers. THE TACTIGON team has produced TACTIGON-SKIN (or T-SKIN), a gesture controller with artificial intellingence algorithms and sensors on board, which solves the not-natural action of the traditional device during interactions with machines.  A mouse typically controls the motion of a pointer in two dimensions in a graphical user interface (GUI). The mouse turns movements of the hand backward and forward, left and right into equivalent electronic signals that in turn are used to move the pointer. Today the new user interface is very complicated with a lot of windows, dashboard and needs interaction with the object.  T-SKIN breaks all this by offering a light, tiny and fashion design device available for everyone, which is not a substitute but instead a complementary part for human machine interface. It's the first programmable (with Arduino also) fashion design hand band, the perfect link between Human and Digital Worlds. You can download the APP for T-SKIN directly from our SKETCH ARENA (our store) and it will turn into a man-machine interface, or a robot controller or a drone controller.  It is very easy to use thanks to its ergonomics form factor; T-SKIN has 4 programmable keys for different combination of hand movements and fingers.  If you use it with a 3D CAD, for example, you can rotate your left or right hand and the object on the screen will follow your movement. Or, you can feel holding the virtual object in your hands and looking at it in all its perspectives using also the key combinations to zoom in or out. KEY POINTS: artificial intelligence algorithms, revolutionary hand form factor, different sizes available, Arduino IDE compatible, SDK available, high accuracy.

Peeki promotes the purchase model that is called “ROPIS”: Reserve-Online-Purchase-In-Store. Through the proprietary marketplace it offers a service that allows: - The physical store to have a ""Plug & Play"" technological solution which operates on different levels of integration, capable of digitizing the warehouse, indexing products, making them visible and available online, in order to satisfy an highly geolocated users’ demand. Through the dashboard it is also possible to manage customer loyalty services such as discount and cashback campaigns, as well as the sale of gift vouchers. - The user has an online service which allows checking, in real time, the availability of products in the nearby stores, book the desired item, go directly to the store and decide whether to complete the purchase. What does it translate into? - saving of time and stress for the user due to continuous searches and phone calls. Buying in the store means trying and touching, no returns due to a wrong purchase. - economic support for commercial activities in the area - relationship of trust and loyalty that develops between customer and seller - makes it possible ""last minute"" purchase, which the e-commerce model cannot satisfy due to logistical reasons - benefit for the environment in terms of environmental impact resulting from CO2 equivalent emissions and packaging avoidance, as natural consequence of the drastic reduction in returns and reverse logistics (on average 1 out of 4 online fashion purchase is returned)",+39 3334264885,davide@peeki.it,https://www.linkedin.com/company/70908820,https://peeki.it/it,,,,,2020-12-05,day,Active,Peeki is an innovative startup born with the idea of ​​bringing the world of online and offline shopping together and working in synergy.,,16121,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",

The company boasts a large and solid structure, based on the Open Innovation model, which currently has six people in the internal team, each of whom is responsible for a key area for the evolution of the project, who coordinate a total of twenty external collaborators.  Its operational HQ is located in Lomazzo, at the ComoNExT Scientific Technological Park, to which iUP got access after winning the ""Business Incubator 2018"" tender, promoted by the Chamber of Commerce of Como and by ComoNExT itself, emerging as the best startup among dozens of participants.  iUP is focused on the development of 2REC, an application designed to revolutionize the approach to voice messages and, more generally, to bring audio communication between people to a more advanced stage - an ambitious project that has allowed it to obtain numerous awards and is offering the company the opportunity to follow a significant path of internationalization.  For example, it has passed the selections for the ""Global Startup Program"" twice in a row; this is an initiative of the MISE promoted on the national territory. In 2019, this allowed it to participate in a three-month acceleration path in Silicon Valley at the Plug & Play Tech Center headquarters, one of the most renowned accelerator hubs in the world, while next summer, it allowed it to access the ""International ScaleUp"" program, also in the United States, at the ""Mind The Bridge"" accelerator in Los Angeles.

Our platform integrates purpose-built experimental protocols, proprietary datasets and advanced design algorithms to accelerate product design and development, from personalized cell therapies to precision fermentation. Officinae Bio comes from the Latin word officinae meaning “the shop where things are designed and manufactured”. Our name reflects our mission to become the leading platform for biology design and build.  What are we building? We’re working to overcome the greatest challenges to a future built with biology; starting with the DNA at the core of all biological engineering. Vulcanus - automated pipelines for long and complex DNA constructs Vulcanus is the first AI-driven pipeline to automate the entire process of building large and complex DNA; from oligo design to fragment assembly. Vulcanus is capable of designing optimal protocols for the build of long and complex DNA constructs up to 50kbp at a 93% success rate - nearly double the success rate of industry standard in time frames that make possible rapid development and screening cycles. Named after the latin god of the forge. Vulcanus was believed to have built the most sophisticated items of ancient lore, including Jupiter’s lightning bolts and Mercury’s winged helm. Ulysses - navigate biological complexity to design superior products Having mastered DNA build, we are developing solutions to the next bottleneck to building with Biology: design.  Our Ulysses algorithm is enabling the smart navigation of complex option spaces when designing biological systems such as cell lines and strains. Ulysses leverages approaches for the design of the whole system rather than engineering individual parts. By recognizing the interconnectivity of all parameters and their nonlinear interactions of the system it allows for more robust, scaleable biological production and designs. Ulysses was the legendary Greek hero and king of Ithaca. His most famous journey was his ten-year struggle to return home through challenges and obstacles but he cleverly navigated through them with his wit and intellect. Next generation, scalable production systems With the foundations of DNA and design mastered, we are turning our unique approach to complexity, computation, automation and molecular biology to build the next generation of biological production systems.

Walle’s mission is to revolutionize urban and interurban mobility in the next 10 years, operating within the UAM (Urban Air Mobility) market, in strong worldwide expansion. Walle’s mission is to eliminate traffic and allow movements first interurban and then urban avoiding hours and hours of traffic from the city. We want to start with Milan. Milan is one of the most mature cities in Europe as sharing mobility. From 2004 until today, Milan Municipality signed agreements with seven car-sharing operators, eight scooter-sharing operators, and three bike-sharing operators. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is going to be a real opportunity and we would like to launch the service during Milano – Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Air Mobility would be the best solution to smartly move both athletes and wealthy travelers between different areas of cities. AIR - Since the beginning, our goal has been connecting ground-to-air with a click: so-called “taxi drones” have been included in our project. Nowadays UAM is just a project, an idea, and taxi drone services seem to be only a product of an SCI-FI writer but, then: why are we considering it? As said above, UAM offers incredible potential and a revolutionary scenario of travel between cities and suburbs. People&#39;s minds will soon be ready, authorities are working towards it, manufacturers are building, testing and certifying their aircraft while Walle is… already there. We want to be one of the first UAM service providers in the world because we strongly believe that this method of transportation, will allow both passengers and goods to travel very quickly through the cities with a fraction of relative costs. As part of the business model, we will be also renting the facilities like vertiports to other operators that will come afterward. By 2050 we will be ten billion on Earth! Of these 10 billion, almost seven billion will live in urban centers. Imagine the cities of the future. Imagine the links between regional cities and imagine the traffic! The biggest problem in the cities of the future will be one: traffic. Imagine the traffic pollution. Imagine the travel between one city to another that will become slower and slower. This problem will be very dangerous also for the people who will use your car for regionals travel. Cities link will be slower and the stress will growth.",,info@wallemobility.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/walle-mobility,https://www.wallemobility.com/,,,,,2020-02-01,day,Active,"""Walle allows you to make short/medium-range air travel in half-time, eliminating traffic stress through a simple, and fast service.

The Oral3D package has all it is needed to create 3D printed models of the patients’ oral cavity with no effort. The Oral3D software and 3D printer do not require any technical knowledge or training. It takes just a couple of minutes to process and send to the 3D printer any CT scan, cone beam or intra-oral scan.  Oral3D models improve dentist-patient communication, which is associated with more accurate diagnosis, better commitment of the patient during the treatment, improved outcomes, and less likelihood of complaints or litigation. In addition, the models support treatment planning and surgical rehearsals, favoring greater efficiency and accuracy.  The use of 3D printing models in dental offices is nowadays crucial in the communication between patients and dentists, making the planning of the treatment easier and increasing the satisfaction. Also the use of the model makes it easier for the dentist to plan the intervention, avoiding to directly plan it in the patient's mouth and decreasing discomfort.

Our Researches & Developments are: Plasma Gasification/Pyrolysis of Municipal/Medical Solid Waste (MSW) Component Of Integrated Waste Recycling: The main advantage of the proposed Plasma Treatment technology by Plasma Dynamics srl is the absence of combustion (oxidation) in the  municipal/medical waste disposal cycle without increasing economical parameters. This sharply reduces the possibility of the formation of hazardous substances such as dioxins, furans, NOx and SOx. This technology makes it possible to obtain zero emissions into the environment through waste processing. Microwave Plasma Filter: The technology is based on the basic properties of microwave plasma, which make it possible to very effectively act on a number of carbon-containing substances, including gaseous ones, from the point of view of their destruction. During this process, dusts and toxic gases are transformed into completely environment friendly components according to U.S. EPA and EU EEA regulation. As United States and European regulations are now focused on reducing Greenhouse gases, mainly Carbon Dioxide (CO2), in Plasma Dynamics srl, we are research and developing the Microwave Plasma Technology to solve this issue.

But is it really possible to define ‘sociality’ an interaction or approach among individuals in a totally virtual way? Social living should be built on natural social interactions. They should go back to verbal confrontation, to communicate through words, looks, and try to avoid confrontation with other individuals just behind a computer screen or a smartphone. But if a person wants to organize a real activity involving other people using some popular social media, how can he organize it without first knowing these individuals?
